# gsl-net
Code generation based on .NET Core

Code generated by a computer can be good-looking,
and can work for large scale engineering because
it results in highly uniform applications.

The templating language GSL is originally
created by Peter Hintjens of iMatix. gsl-net
is powered by Javascript and its syntax 
reads like this:

    . /* this is a comment */
    . for (var i = 0; i < 10; i ++) {
    .    setOutput('SKU' + i.toString() + '.cs');
    /**
     * Generated by gsl-net
     * do not modify by hand.
     */
    namespace Demo
    {
        public class SKU${i.toString()}
        {
            
        }
    }
    .}
